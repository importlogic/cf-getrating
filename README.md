Get rating for Codeforces problems even with problem tags off.
This Codeforces Get Rating extension helps users to just view the problem rating without seeing the other tags.

This extension is very helpful while practicing problems on Codeforces as it helps you to know the rating of the problem without explicitly knowing the tags associated with it.

How to use : 
1. Install the extension.
2. Turn off [ Show tags for unsolved problems ] option in the Problemset page of Codeforces.
3. Open any Codeforces problem and it will show the problem rating.

*NOTE* The extension does not work when the Codeforces API is down.

*NOTE* The extension does not work with problems that do not have a problem rating.
